# Image-denoising-with-Non-Local-Means
This project was implemented as part of an assignment of the course Probability and Random Processes (ES 331) at IIT Gandhinagar. 
It uses the Non Local Means algorithm to perform image denoising. The noise is explicitly added to the original images, and is of two varieties - Gaussian and Salt &amp; Pepper type. A simple Gaussian Smoothening filter is also used to denoise these images, and the results are compared with those generated with Non Local Means algorithm.
The .ipynb file is added here, which can be accessed and actively worked with in Google Colaboratory. 
# Report
A short report on the observations made from this implementation and analysis is added as [Report](https://github.com/shrutipgupta/Image-denoising-with-Non-Local-Means-/blob/main/Report.pdf). The original and denoised images are also added, for the best output cases, in the folder named "Results". 
# Reference
[This](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1467423) paper, titled "A non-local algorithm for image denoising" was used as the reference for understanding the algorithm.
